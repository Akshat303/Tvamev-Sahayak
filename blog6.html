            <h2 align="center">MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING</h2><br>
            <p>
                Mental health has been one of the most talked-about topics in the past few years and has been
on the rise ever since. Each day we hear one or the other thing about it, but it is important to
know what exactly mental health is. <br>
Our emotional, social and psychological well-being adds up to our mental health. The direct
influence of our mental health is on the way we think, act as well as feel. It often determines the
way we make our decisions and choices, integrate with others in society, and act in case of
stressful situations. <br><br>
The moment we are conceived, our life begins, going through various phases from childhood to
late old age. Throughout these stages, an important constant is one’s mental health.<br>
In the words of Soren Kierkegaard, ‘The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be
heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived’. In order to live your life in
the best way possible, your mental health should be just as healthy. Good mental health doesn't
imply the absence of an illness but rather an overall state of well-being.<br><br>
In general, the concept relates to how one enjoys their life, how resilient one is when faced with
stress and sadness, their ability to set and fulfill their goals, and how one builds and maintains
their relationships.<br><br>
Now coming on to some of the factors which may be contributing to mental health problems
include biological factors, life events and experiences, and family history.<br>
Biological factors are influenced by one's genetics, and life experiences include any abuse or
trauma. Whereas, family history is the history of problems, especially mental health problems in
the family. When one has good mental health, it becomes easier for them to reach their
potential, learn how to effectively cope with stressors, productively engage in their work,and
contribute to society.<br><br>
In case one has mental health problems or wants to reach out for help, they can get in touch
with a professional, who will accordingly help them. One can also communicate with others, with
the people they trust and feel comfortable around. Moreover exercising regularly, helping those
who are in need, and developing healthy coping mechanisms are some other things which one
can do.<br><br>
